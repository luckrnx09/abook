## Getting started
### Prepare
Run `cp .env.example .env` then fill the `.env` file:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Required, string, type your open api key
- OPENAI_MODEL: Required, string, type your open ai model name
- OPENAI_BASE_URL: Optional, string, type your custom openai api url
- VERBOSE: Optional, `true` or `false`, determine whether or not to print conversation details when interacting with openai

### Install
You can install `abook` as a global command as following: 
```bash
yarn global add abook
```
or
```bash
npm install -g abook
```
or
```bash
pnpm install -g abook
```
Then you can use `abook -V` to print the abook version installed.

If you don't want to install it globally, you can use `npx` to run abook directly: 
```bash
npx abook
```
