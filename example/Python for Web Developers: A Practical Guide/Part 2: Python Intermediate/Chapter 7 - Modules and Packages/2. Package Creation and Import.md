## 2. Package Creation and Import

In Python, a package is a directory that contains multiple Python modules, while a module is a single Python file. The concept of packages and modules in Python is similar to organizing and structuring code in JavaScript using files and directories.

### Programming Task

Create a Python package named "math_operations" that contains two modules: "basic_operations" and "advanced_operations". 

1. In the "basic_operations" module, define the following functions:
   - `add(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
   - `subtract(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their difference.
   - `multiply(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their product.
   - `divide(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their quotient.

2. In the "advanced_operations" module, define the following functions:
   - `power(base, exponent)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns the result of raising the base to the exponent.
   - `sqrt(number)`: Takes a number as input and returns its square root.
   - `factorial(number)`: Takes a number as input and returns its factorial.

Now, let's see the implementation of the above task in JavaScript and Python:

JavaScript implementation:

// JavaScript implementation is not provided as the reader is already familiar with JavaScript
```

Python implementation:

1. Create a directory named "math_operations" and two Python files, "basic_operations.py" and "advanced_operations.py" inside it.

2. In the "basic_operations.py" file, write the following code:
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
        return None
    return a / b
```

3. In the "advanced_operations.py" file, write the following code:
```python
import math

def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** exponent

def sqrt(number):
    return math.sqrt(number)

def factorial(number):
    if number == 0:
        return 1
    return number * factorial(number - 1)
```

### Syntax Highlights

- Python uses directories and modules to organize and structure code, similar to JavaScript with files and directories.
- Python modules use the `.py` extension, while JavaScript files typically have the `.js` extension.
- In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing the parameters.
- Python uses indentation (typically 4 spaces) to indicate blocks of code, while JavaScript uses curly braces `{}`.
- Python uses the `import` keyword to import modules and access their functions, similar to JavaScript's `import` or `require` statements.
- Python uses the `**` operator for exponentiation, while JavaScript uses the `**` operator or the `Math.pow()` function.
- Python provides a built-in `math` module that contains various mathematical functions.
- Python allows recursive function calls, as shown in the factorial example.



### General APIs

| Feature | JavaScript | Python |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Package Creation | `npm init` | `python setup.py sdist` |
| Package Import | `require('package-name')` | `import package_name` |
