## 2. Anonymous Functions

In Python, anonymous functions are created using the `lambda` keyword. They are also known as lambda functions or lambda expressions. Lambda functions are used when we need a small piece of code that can be executed inline without defining a separate function.

In JavaScript, anonymous functions can be created using the `function` keyword without providing a name. They are commonly used as callback functions or when we need a function for a short period of time.

### Programming Task

Create a program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with each number squared. This task will cover most of the Python concepts related to anonymous functions.

JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
// Input list
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Map each number to its square using anonymous function
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number ** 2;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers);
```

Python implementation:

```python
# Input list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Map each number to its square using anonymous function
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda number: number ** 2, numbers))

print(squared_numbers)
```

### Syntax Highlights
- In Python, anonymous functions are created using the `lambda` keyword.
- In JavaScript, anonymous functions are created using the `function` keyword without providing a name.
