## 1. Hot on Github

Python is a widely used programming language and is gaining popularity on GitHub. It is important for JavaScript engineers to get up to speed quickly in Python to stay updated with the latest trends in the programming community.

### Programming Task

Let's create a task that covers most of the Python syntax and APIs related to the concepts the reader has acquired so far.

The task is to write a program that reads a JSON file containing information about popular GitHub projects and fetches relevant data from the GitHub API for each project. The program should then save the fetched data to a separate JSON file.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
// JavaScript implementation without using any concepts the reader hasn't acquired
// Assumes a JSON file called 'projects.json' is available

const fs = require('fs');
const { default: axios } = require('axios');

// Read the projects.json file
const projects = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('projects.json'));

// Fetch GitHub API data for each project
for (const project of projects) {
  const url = `https://api.github.com/repos/${project.owner}/${project.name}`;
  axios.get(url).then(response => {
    const projectData = response.data;
    // Save the fetched data to a JSON file
    fs.writeFileSync(`${project.name}.json`, JSON.stringify(projectData));
  });
}
```

Python implementation:
```python
# Python implementation with comments, using concepts the reader has acquired
# Assumes a JSON file called 'projects.json' is available

import json
import requests

# Read the projects.json file
with open('projects.json', 'r') as file:
    projects = json.load(file)

# Fetch GitHub API data for each project
for project in projects:
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{project['owner']}/{project['name']}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    project_data = response.json()
    # Save the fetched data to a JSON file
    with open(f"{project['name']}.json", 'w') as file:
        json.dump(project_data, file)
```

### Syntax Highlights
- JavaScript:
  - Using `require` to import modules.
  - Using `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync` for file reading and writing.
  - Using `axios` for making HTTP requests.
- Python:
  - Using `import` to import modules.
  - Using `open` to handle file reading and writing.
  - Using `json.load` and `json.dump` for JSON serialization and deserialization.
  - Using `requests.get` to make HTTP requests.

By focusing on the above programming task, JavaScript engineers can quickly get up to speed in Python and confidently start working on Python projects.
