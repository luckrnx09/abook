## 1. Book Store

In Python, a book store can be represented as a class that contains properties and methods for managing books. This is similar to how objects are defined in JavaScript.

### Programming Task

Create a Book class that can be used to represent books in a book store. The class should have the following properties:

- title: a string that represents the title of the book
- author: a string that represents the author of the book
- price: a float that represents the price of the book

The class should also have the following methods:

- get_details: a method that returns a string representation of the book's details
- apply_discount: a method that applies a discount to the book's price

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, price) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.price = price;
  }

  get_details() {
    return `Title: ${this.title}, Author: ${this.author}, Price: ${this.price}`;
  }

  apply_discount(discount) {
    this.price -= this.price * (discount / 100);
  }
}

// Create a new book object
const book = new Book("JavaScript in Action", "John Doe", 29.99);

console.log(book.get_details()); // Output: Title: JavaScript in Action, Author: John Doe, Price: 29.99

book.apply_discount(10);
console.log(book.get_details()); // Output: Title: JavaScript in Action, Author: John Doe, Price: 26.99
```

Python implementation:
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price

    def get_details(self):
        return f"Title: {self.title}, Author: {self.author}, Price: {self.price}"

    def apply_discount(self, discount):
        self.price -= self.price * (discount / 100)

# Create a new book object
book = Book("JavaScript in Action", "John Doe", 29.99)

print(book.get_details()) # Output: Title: JavaScript in Action, Author: John Doe, Price: 29.99

book.apply_discount(10)
print(book.get_details()) # Output: Title: JavaScript in Action, Author: John Doe, Price: 26.99
```

### Syntax Highlights
- In JavaScript, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, while in Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword as well.
- JavaScript uses the `constructor` method to initialize properties of a class, whereas in Python, the initialization is done in the `__init__` method.
- JavaScript uses the `this` keyword to refer to the current instance of the class, while in Python, the `self` keyword is used for the same purpose.
- JavaScript string interpolation is done using template literals (backticks), while in Python, f-strings are used for string interpolation.
