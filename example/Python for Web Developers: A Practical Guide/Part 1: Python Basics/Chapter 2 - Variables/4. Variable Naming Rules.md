## 4. Variable Naming Rules

In Python, just like in JavaScript, variables are used to store values. However, there are some rules and conventions for naming variables in Python that you should be aware of. Let's take a look at them:

1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. Variable names can only contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).
3. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVar" and "myvar" are two different variables.
4. It is recommended to use lowercase letters for variable names, as it is the common convention in Python.
5. Avoid using reserved keywords or built-in function names as variable names.

In addition to these general variable naming rules, there are also specific naming conventions for different types of variables in Python:

- Class Names: Start with an uppercase letter and use camel case. For example: MyClass.

- Function Names: Words should be separated by underscores (_) and lowercase letters should be used. For example: my_function.

- Constants: All uppercase letters separated by underscores (_) should be used. For example: MY_CONSTANT.

Now let's practice these variable naming rules with a programming task that covers most of the Python syntax and APIs related to this article.

### Programming Task

Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle and outputs the result.
The program should accomplish the following tasks:

1. Prompt the user to enter the width and height of the rectangle.
2. Convert the user input from strings to integers.
3. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the width and height.
4. Output the calculated area to the console.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
const width = prompt("Enter the width: ");
const height = prompt("Enter the height: ");

const area = width * height;

console.log("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);
```

Python implementation:
```python
width = int(input("Enter the width: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height: "))

area = width * height

print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
```

### Syntax Highlights

- In JavaScript, variable declaration uses the `const` keyword, while in Python, there is no need for a specific keyword to declare a variable.
- In Python, user input is read using the `input` function, while in JavaScript, `prompt` is used.
- Python uses the `int` function to convert a string to an integer, while JavaScript has different methods for type conversion depending on the data type.
- Python uses the `print` function to output to the console, while JavaScript uses `console.log`.
