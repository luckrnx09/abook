## 1. Variable Definition and Assignment

In Python, variables are defined using the assignment operator (`=`). Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variables do not have to be declared with a specific type before they can be assigned a value. This is different from JavaScript, which is a statically-typed language and requires variable declarations.

Programming Task:

Define three variables in Python: `name` (string), `age` (integer), and `is_student` (boolean). Assign appropriate values to these variables and print them to the console.

JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
let isStudent = true;

console.log(name);
console.log(age);
console.log(isStudent);
```

Python implementation:

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True

print(name)
print(age)
print(is_student)
```

Syntax Highlights:
- Python uses a single equal sign `=` for assignment, while JavaScript uses two equal signs `==` for comparison and three equal signs `===` for strict comparison.
- Python does not require the use of semicolons at the end of each statement, unlike JavaScript.



### General APIs

| Feature | JavaScript | Python |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Variable Declaration | `var variableName;` | `variableName = None` or `variableName = <value>` |
| Variable Assignment | `variableName = value;` | `variableName = <value>` |
| Multiple Variable Declaration and Assignment | `var variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2;` | `variable1 = variable2 = <value>` |
| Constant Declaration | `const constantName = value;` | `CONSTANT_NAME = value` |
| Type Declaration | `let variableName: type;` | `variableName: type` |
