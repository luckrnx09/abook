## 2. Hello World

In Python, the "Hello World" program is typically the first program that beginners write when learning a new programming language. It is a simple program that prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. This program is used to verify that the language is correctly installed and that the development environment is set up correctly.

In JavaScript, a similar "Hello World" program can be written using the `console.log()` function. However, the syntax and conventions used in Python are different. 

### Programming Task

Let's create a program that prompts the user to enter their name and then prints a customized greeting message using that name.

JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
let name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
```

Python implementation:

```python
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### Syntax Highlights

- In Python, the input prompt can be obtained using the `input()` function, whereas in JavaScript, the input can be obtained using the `prompt()` function.
- In Python, string interpolation can be achieved using the `f"..."` format. In JavaScript, template literals are used with the backtick (` `) character.
- Python uses the `print()` function to display output to the console, while JavaScript uses the `console.log()` function.



### General APIs
