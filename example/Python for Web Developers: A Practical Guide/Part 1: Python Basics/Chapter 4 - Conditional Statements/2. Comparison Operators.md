In Python, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False). These operators are used to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on conditions. In JavaScript, there are similar comparison operators with slightly different syntax.

### Programming Task

Let's write a program that takes two numbers as input and checks if the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
let num1 = prompt("Enter the first number: ");
let num2 = prompt("Enter the second number: ");

if(num1 > num2){
    console.log(num1 + " is greater than " + num2);
} else if(num1 < num2){
    console.log(num1 + " is less than " + num2);
} else {
    console.log(num1 + " is equal to " + num2);
}
```

Python implementation:
```python
num1 = input("Enter the first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter the second number: ")

if num1 > num2:
    print(num1 + " is greater than " + num2)
elif num1 < num2:
    print(num1 + " is less than " + num2)
else:
    print(num1 + " is equal to " + num2)
```

### Syntax Highlights

- The `input` function is used in Python to take user input, while in JavaScript we use `prompt`.
- In Python, we don't need to explicitly convert the input to a number using `parseInt` like we do in JavaScript.
- In Python, `print` is used to output text to the console, while in JavaScript we use `console.log`.
- The syntax for the `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements is the same in both languages.

| Not equal to        | `!=`                                | `!=`                                 |
| Strict equal to     | `===`                               | `is`                                 |
| Strict not equal to | `!==`                               | `is not`                             |
| Greater than        | `>`                                 | `>`                                  |
| Less than           | `<`                                 | `<`                                  |
| Greater than or equal to | `>=`                          | `>=`                                 |
| Less than or equal to    | `<=`                          | `<=`                                 |
