## 4. List Comprehension and Dictionary Comprehension

In Python, list comprehension and dictionary comprehension provide concise ways to create lists and dictionaries.

### Programming Task

Design a programming task that covers list comprehension and dictionary comprehension based on the concepts the reader has acquired so far.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
// Let's say we have an array of numbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// We want to create a new array containing the squared values of the original array
let squaredNumbers = [];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  squaredNumbers.push(numbers[i] ** 2);
}
console.log(squaredNumbers);

// Now, let's say we have an array of words
let words = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'javascript'];

// We want to create a new array containing the lengths of the words in the original array
let wordLengths = [];
for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
  wordLengths.push(words[i].length);
}
console.log(wordLengths);
```

Python implementation:
```python
# Let's say we have a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# We want to create a new list containing the squared values of the original list
squared_numbers = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)

# Now, let's say we have a list of words
words = ['hello', 'world', 'python', 'javascript']

# We want to create a new list containing the lengths of the words in the original list
word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]
print(word_lengths)
```

### Syntax Highlights
- In Python, list comprehension is written inside square brackets, whereas in JavaScript, it is implemented using a for loop and push method.
- List comprehension in Python uses a concise syntax to generate a new list based on an existing list, eliminating the need for explicit iteration.
- The syntax for list comprehension in Python is `[expression for item in list]`.
- Python's list comprehension can also include conditional statements, allowing for more complex filtering of the original list.
- Python's dictionary comprehension follows a similar syntax and is used to create dictionaries based on existing data.



### General APIs

| Feature | JavaScript | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List Comprehension | `[element for element in iterable]` | `[expression for element in iterable]` |
| Conditional Filtering | `[element for element in iterable if condition]` | `[expression for element in iterable if condition]` |
| Nested List Comprehension | `[expression for element in iterable if condition for element in iterable]` | `[expression for element in iterable for element in iterable if condition]` |
| Dictionary Comprehension | `[{key: value} for element in iterable]` | `{key: value for element in iterable}` |
| Conditional Filtering in Dictionary Comprehension | `{key: value for element in iterable if condition}` | `{key: value for element in iterable if condition}` |
| Nested Dictionary Comprehension | `{key1: {key2: value} for element in iterable if condition} for element in iterable if condition` | `{key1: {key2: value} for element in iterable if condition} for element in iterable if condition` |
