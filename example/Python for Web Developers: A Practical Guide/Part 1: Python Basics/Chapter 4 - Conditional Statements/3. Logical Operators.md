## 3. Logical Operators

In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and perform logical operations. The logical operators available in Python are:

- `and`: Returns `True` if both the conditions are true.
- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one of the conditions is true.
- `not`: Returns the opposite boolean value of the condition.

These operators are similar to JavaScript's logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), but there are some syntax and behavior differences.

### Programming Task

Write a program that determines the eligibility for a driving license based on age and previous driving experience. 

1. Define two variables: `age` and `experience`, both with integer values.
2. Implement the following logic in both JavaScript and Python using the logical operators:
   - If the age is greater than or equal to 18 and the experience is greater than or equal to 1, print "Eligible for a driving license".
   - Otherwise, print "Not eligible for a driving license".
3. Display the results.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
// Define variables
let age = 20;
let experience = 2;

// Check eligibility for a driving license
if (age >= 18 && experience >= 1) {
  console.log("Eligible for a driving license");
} else {
  console.log("Not eligible for a driving license");
}
```

Python implementation:
```python
# Define variables
age = 20
experience = 2

# Check eligibility for a driving license
if age >= 18 and experience >= 1:
    print("Eligible for a driving license")
else:
    print("Not eligible for a driving license")
```

### Syntax Highlights

- In Python, `and` replaces `&&` for logical conjunction.
- In Python, `or` replaces `||` for logical disjunction.
- In Python, `not` replaces `!` for logical negation.

| Logical OR             | `||`                      | `or`                      |
| Logical NOT            | `!`                       | `not`                     |
| Ternary Operator       | `condition ? expr1 : expr2`| `expr1 if condition else expr2`|
