## 3. break and continue

In Python, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements that are used to alter the execution of loops.

- `break`: It is used to terminate the loop prematurely. When `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program execution moves to the next statement after the loop.

- `continue`: It is used to skip the rest of the loop body for the current iteration. When `continue` statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration is terminated and the program execution moves to the next iteration.

In JavaScript, there are equivalents `break` and `continue` statements available, which have similar functionalities.

### Programming Task

Write a program to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to a given number (inclusive). The program should:

- Prompt the user to enter a number.
- Use a while loop to iterate from 1 to the given number.
- For each iteration, check if the current number is even or odd.
  - If the number is odd, skip the rest of the loop body for the current iteration using `continue` statement.
  - If the number is even, add it to a running total.
- After the loop ends, output the sum of all even numbers.

JavaScript implementation:
```
let number = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));
let sum = 0;
let i = 1;

while (i <= number) {
  if (i % 2 === 1) {
    i++;
    continue;
  }

  sum += i;
  i++;
}

console.log("Sum of all even numbers:", sum);
```

Python implementation:
```
number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= number:
    if i % 2 == 1:
        i += 1
        continue

    sum += i
    i += 1

print("Sum of all even numbers:", sum)
```

### Syntax Highlights

- JavaScript: 
  - `parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"))` is used to obtain user input.
  - `console.log()` is used to output the result.

- Python:
  - `int(input("Enter a number:"))` is used to obtain user input.
  - `print()` is used to output the result.



### General APIs

| Feature            | JavaScript   | Python       |
