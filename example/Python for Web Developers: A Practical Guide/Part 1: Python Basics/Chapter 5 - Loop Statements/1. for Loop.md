## 1. for Loop

In Python, the `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. It allows you to execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

Equivalent in JavaScript:
In JavaScript, you can also use the `for` loop to iterate over an array or string. However, the syntax is slightly different compared to Python.

### Programming Task

Design a programming task to demonstrate the usage of the `for` loop in Python. This task will cover various concepts that the reader has acquired so far.

JavaScript implementation:
```
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  sum += numbers[i];
}

console.log("Sum:", sum);
```

Python implementation:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum = 0

for number in numbers:
  sum += number

print("Sum:", sum)
```

### Syntax Highlights

- In Python, a `for` loop is written as `for item in sequence:`, while in JavaScript, it is written as `for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`.
- In Python, the loop variable is assigned the value of each item in the sequence directly, while in JavaScript, it is accessed using indexing (`array[i]`).
- Python uses indentation to denote the body of the loop, while JavaScript uses curly braces (`{}`).
- Python does not require an explicit termination condition in the loop syntax.



### General APIs
| Feature            | JavaScript                    | Python                              |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `for` loop         | `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` | `for i in range(n):`                 |
| `range` function   | -                             | `range(start, stop, step)`           |
| `enumerate` function | -                           | `enumerate(iterable, start=0)`       |

- The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. In JavaScript, it typically uses a counter variable and a condition to control the loop. In Python, it uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers and iterates over them.
- The `range` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers based on the given parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. It is commonly used with the `for` loop to iterate a specific number of times or over a specific range of values.
- The `enumerate` function in Python is used to loop over an iterable while keeping track of the index of each item. It returns a tuple containing both the index and the item itself.
