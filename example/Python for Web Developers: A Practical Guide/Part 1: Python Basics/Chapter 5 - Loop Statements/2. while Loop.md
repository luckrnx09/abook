## 2. while Loop

The `while` loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given condition. In Python, the `while` loop syntax is similar to JavaScript's `while` loop syntax.

### Programming Task

Design a task to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 and print the result. The task should use the `while` loop and cover the concepts the reader has already acquired.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
let sum = 0;
let i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
  sum += i;
  i++;
}
console.log(sum);
```

Python implementation:

```python
sum = 0
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    sum += i
    i += 1
print(sum)
```

### Syntax Highlights

The syntax for the `while` loop in Python is identical to that in JavaScript:
- The condition is written in the parentheses after the `while` keyword.
- The code block to be executed is indented after a colon.

No additional syntax differences exist between the JavaScript and Python code snippets above.



### General APIs

|Feature | JavaScript | Python|
|--------|------------|-------|
|Loop condition | `while (condition)` | `while condition:` |
|Loop body | `{// code block}` | `# code block` |
|Loop control | `break;` | `break` |
|Loop control | `continue;` | `continue` |
