## 3. Inheritance and Polymorphism

In Python, inheritance is a way to create a new class by deriving it from an existing class. The new class will have all the characteristics and behaviors of the existing class, and can also add its own attributes and methods. This allows for code reusability and promotes the concept of "is-a" relationship.

Polymorphism in Python is the ability to use an object of a derived class wherever an object of the base class is expected. It allows methods to be overridden in subclasses, providing different implementations for the same method name. This way, the appropriate method is called implicitly based on the object's type.

In JavaScript, objects are created using prototypal inheritance. While JavaScript does not have explicit class-based inheritance like Python, it has a prototype chain that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. This concept is similar to inheritance in Python, but the syntax and implementation details are different.

### Programming Task

Task: Create a class hierarchy for different shapes, starting with a base class `Shape`. Each shape should have a method called `area` that calculates and returns the area of the shape.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
class Shape {
  // Base class
  constructor() {}
  
  // Calculate and return the area of the shape
  area() {}
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  // Derived class: Circle
  constructor(radius) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  
  // Override area method for Circle
  area() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  // Derived class: Rectangle
  constructor(width, height) {
    super();
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
  
  // Override area method for Rectangle
  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}
```

Python implementation:
```python
class Shape:
    # Base class
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    # Calculate and return the area of the shape
    def area(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    # Derived class: Circle
    def __init__(self, radius):
        super().__init__()
        self.radius = radius
    
    # Override area method for Circle
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

class Rectangle(Shape):
    # Derived class: Rectangle
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    # Override area method for Rectangle
    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height
}
```

### Syntax Highlights

- JavaScript:
  - Class declaration: `class ClassName {`
  - Constructor: `constructor() { ... }`
  - Extending a class: `class DerivedClass extends BaseClass { ... }`
  - Method overriding: `methodName() { ... }`
    
- Python:
  - Class declaration: `class ClassName:`
  - Constructor: `def __init__(self):`
  - Inheritance: `class DerivedClass(BaseClass):`
  - Method overriding: `def methodName(self):`
