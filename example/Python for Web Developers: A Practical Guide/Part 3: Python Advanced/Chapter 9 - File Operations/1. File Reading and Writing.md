## 1. File Reading and Writing

In Python, file reading and writing can be achieved using the built-in `open()` function. This function takes a filename as its argument and returns a file object. The file object provides various methods for reading and writing to the file.

In JavaScript, file reading and writing can be done using the `fs` module for Node.js or `FileReader` and `FileWriter` objects for web-based JavaScript. These methods have different syntax and APIs compared to Python.

### Programming Task

Design a complex programming task that covers most of the Python syntax and APIs related to file reading and writing.

JavaScript implementation:
```javascript
// TODO: Implement with JavaScript
```

Python implementation:
```python
# Given a file containing a list of numbers, calculate the sum of all odd numbers and write it to another file.

def calculate_sum_of_odd_numbers(input_file, output_file):
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
            numbers = file.readlines()
        
        sum_of_odd_numbers = 0
        
        for number in numbers:
            number = int(number.strip())  # convert string to integer
            if number % 2 != 0:  # check if number is odd
                sum_of_odd_numbers += number
                
        with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
            file.write(str(sum_of_odd_numbers))  # convert integer to string before writing
        
        return sum_of_odd_numbers
        
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Input file not found!"
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
        
# Example usage
input_file = 'numbers.txt'
output_file = 'result.txt'
result = calculate_sum_of_odd_numbers(input_file, output_file)
print(f'Sum of odd numbers: {result}')
```

### Syntax Highlights

- Python uses `open()` function to open a file and JavaScript uses `fs` module or `FileReader/FileWriter` objects.
- Python uses the `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed, while JavaScript requires manual closing of file handles.
- Python file objects have `read()` and `readlines()` methods, while JavaScript has different methods like `fs.readFileSync()` or `reader.readAsText()`.
- Python file objects can be used with `with` statement to automatically close the file, while JavaScript file handles need to be explicitly closed using `fs.close()` or `fileObject.close()`.
- Python uses the `write()` method to write data to a file, while JavaScript has different methods like `fs.writeFileSync()` or `writer.write()`.
- Python uses the `w` mode for opening a file for writing, while JavaScript uses flags like `w`, `r` or `a` to specify the file access mode.
- Python file paths can be specified using backslashes (`\`), forward slashes (`/`), or by using raw string literals (`r"path\to\file.txt"`), while JavaScript file paths are specified using forward slashes only.
- Python uses the `try-except` statement to handle exceptions when opening or reading files, while JavaScript uses `try-catch` blocks.
- Reading a file line by line in Python is done using a `for` loop, while JavaScript uses different methods like `fs.readFileSync()`, `reader.readAsText()` or `stream.on('data', ...)`.



### General APIs

| Feature               | JavaScript                              | Python                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Read file             | `fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8')`       | `open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8')`     |
| Write to file         | `fs.writeFileSync(file, data, 'utf-8')` | `open(file, 'w', encoding='utf-8')`     |
| Append to file        | `fs.appendFileSync(file, data, 'utf-8')` | `open(file, 'a', encoding='utf-8')`     |
| Read file asynchronously | `fs.readFile(file, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {...})` | `with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: data = f.read()` |
| Write to file asynchronously | `fs.writeFile(file, data, 'utf-8', err => {...})` | `with open(file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(data)` |
| Append to file asynchronously | `fs.appendFile(file, data, 'utf-8', err => {...})` | `with open(file, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(data)` |
| Check if file exists   | `fs.existsSync(file)`                   | `os.path.exists(file)`                   |
