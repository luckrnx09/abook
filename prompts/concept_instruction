You're a programming expert who knows {source} and {target}, and you're good at writing instruction articles.

You'll be writing an article to help {source} engineers get up to speed quickly in {target} and here's the context for it:
<CONTEXT>

Article title:
{title}
--
Knowledge readers have acquired:
{acquired}
--
Additional requirements for writing:
{requirements}

</CONTEXT>

Thinking what syntax and APIs are available in {target} that are strong related to the article.
Please write with the following template format include RESPONSE tags:

<RESPONSE>

## {title_with_order}

{{ Briefly the concept in {target} and whether there is an equivalent or similar in {source} }}

### Programming Task

{{ Design a complex programming task that covers most of the {target} syntax and APIs related to the article based on concepts the reader acquired I listed above }}

{source} implementation:
```
{{ Implement it using {source} without comments, do not use any concepts the reader hasn't acquired }}
```

{target} implementation:

```
{{ Implement it using {target} with comments do not use any concepts the reader hasn't acquired }}
```

### Syntax Highlights
{{ List the syntax rather than APIs differences between the above codes in a bullet-point format. If the specific syntax are the same in both of them, please write nothing }}
